Hi, I'm Murphy Tian, an undergraduate researcher at University of Toronto. I'm currently a research engineer at Tencent. I am fortunate to work with talented research advisors: Prof. [Jiaxuan You](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jiaxuan/) at U Lab on agentic reinforcement learning and Prof. [JunCheng Yang](https://junchengyang.com/) at Harvard MadSys Lab on LLM serving systems.  I have open-source experience as a core contributor of [OpenManus](https://github.com/FoundationAgents/OpenManus) and a Google Summer of Code contributor to ChromiumOS, along with industry engineering background from working at Microsoft Research, Microsoft and RedNote. I was previously advised by Dr. [Daniela Rosu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniela-rosu-704828/) on interpretable agentic systems.

My research focuses on building more capable intelligence through two complementary directions: 
(1) **Post-training and agentic systems** — exploring reinforcement learning methods for agent capabilities, frameworks for automatic agentic system generation and optimization, and interpretability and explainability for agentic systems; 
(2) **Efficient and reliable machine learning systems** — building infrastructure for inference optimization, scheduling, and resource utilization to make large language model systems more accessible and sustainable. 

Feel free to reach out to explore potential research opportunities.
