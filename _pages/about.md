Hi, Iâ€™m Murphy Tian, an undergraduate student at University of Toronto. I'm
currently a research intern in Microsoft Research Asia. I was a prev Software Engineer in Microsoft. I'm currently fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Jiaxuan You](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jiaxuan/) at ULab.
I am interested in constructing complex software engineering system, especially operating system, database system, and distributed system.
