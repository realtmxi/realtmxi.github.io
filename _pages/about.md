Hi, I’m Murphy Tian.
I’m currently a research intern in Microsoft Research Asia. I was a prev Software Engineer in Microsoft. I pursued my bachelor degree from University of Toronto, Computer Science Department.
I am interested in constructing complex software engineering system, especially operating system, database system, and distributed system.

My research interests are centered around LLM Agent and ML System (both Sys4ML and ML4Sys). Feel free to reach out me to explore potential research opportunities.
